        "My aim is to find associations between a person's score in Big-5 personality assessment and the emotions depicted by lyrics of their favourite songs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this purpose, I have collected data from more than 50 participants. This data consists of\n",
        "* demographic data\n",
        "* big-5 personality assessment data\n",
        "* name and artist of 3 to 10 favourite songs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Process\n",
        "1. Gather lyrics of songs\n",
        "2. Analyze the emotions depected in lyrics\n",
        "3. Analyze associations between the Big-5 personality scores and emotions depected in lyrics\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. I will automate the lyrics gathering process by using `lyrics-extractor` package, which searches the song on Google and scrapes the lyrics shown on the results page. I also tried other packages for searching lyrics, but the problem with them is that they are not tolerant to spelling mistakes and incomplete words. The data was collected by circulating a Google form, there are high chances of misspelled and incomplete song names.  \n",
        "After extracting the lyrics, we need to remove any labelling brackets like *\\[chorus\\]* or *\\[bridge\\]* as they may contain meaningful words which may affect the analysis of emotions. For this purpose I will use regular expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. To analyze the emotions depected in lyrics, I will use Tone Analyzer service by IBM Watson. This service takes in the lyrics and return the scorings of lyrics in 13 different components which consist of Big-5 components O,C,E,A,N under social category and anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness under emotional category and analytical, confident, and tentative under language category.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Once we have all the scores for each song, we need to calculate cummulative scores for each participant. To calculate cummulative scores, we will do average of each emotion type accross all the favourite songs. This will give us a score vector against each participant.  \n",
        "Where ever the score is less than 0.5, we will make it zero. It's done because according to the IBM watson documents, it's difficult to percieve the emotions which score less than 0.5.\n"
